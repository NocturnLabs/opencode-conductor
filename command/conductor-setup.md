description: Initialize project with Conductor context files
---

I will initialize the Conductor directory and scaffold the core context files (product.md, tech-stack.md, workflow.md, and tracks.md).

<call:conductor_init />

Once initialized, please update these files to reflect your project's goals and architecture.
